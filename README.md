##Create responsive, user friendly style guides

Few style guides allow you to test components responsively, allowing you to test each component at different widths. Few style guides have a high degree of usability, catering for the needs of fellow designers and developers. Tensile gives you both.

Tensile achieves complete separation between your styleguide interface and your refernced components by sandboxing them within their own paths, giving you a classy style guide UX right out of the box.

Tentile is a framework, built in Javascript, that allows you easily compile a style guide containing snippets of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Examples and instructions coming soon.
